# DataScience_Challenge

The file prices.csv describes prices collected for products, represented as UPC, at specific physical store locations, 
represented as Store ID. The auditors who collected prices at each store are represented as Auditor ID. Store attribute 
information is described in stores.json, and auditor information is shown in auditors.csv. Can you transform these 
sources into a cross-tabulation of regional prices alongside each other, broken down by banner, and write this out to a 
spreadsheet (CSV or XLSX)? Note that a given product is not guaranteed to be found in all markets at a given banner.

See data_challenge_directions.png for example result.
